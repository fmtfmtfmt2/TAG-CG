				Once I turned 13, I graduated from Junior Zookeeper and became a <span>Conservation Guide (CG)</span>. Unlike Junior Zookeepers, who work closer with the animals and their maintenance, Conservation Guides focus on guest interaction and aquire the skills of <span>public interaction, responsibility, and initiative</span>.<img src="http://i.imgur.com/e39oBbS.png"; align="left"; id="JZLogo"; style="height:150px" /><img src="https://scontent-mia1-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/11098316_417326361805697_2024966877_n.jpg"; id="chimp"; style="width:250px"; align="right" /> Conservation Guides teach children about different animals, their role in nature, and will always try to leave a positive message about animal conservation with the kids. Animal conservation is a big focus at the Dallas Zoo and in the Conservation Guide program. We try to promote conservation through animal encounters, educational games, and creative crafts.

				<span>Possible places to work:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Discovery House</span>- The Discovery House is a small building filled with activities, games, and crafts that that teach kids about nature and animals. The activities in the Discovery House are targeted at preschoolers, so the Conservation Guides will always "dummy down" how we speak so that the kids can comprehend and understand. We often have <span>animal encounters</span> in the Discovery House.<img src="http://i68.tinypic.com/dvhdsy.jpg"; id="chimp"; style="width:200px"; align="right" /> Animal encounters are when a zookeeper brings and animal, such as a snake or owl, and talks about it. At the beginning of the session, the Conservation Guides were only allowed to hold the animals, but further into the session, we were able to give the presentations, too. In the Discovery House, the CGs also cleaned, made animal enrichment (anything that animal can play with that enriches any of its senses), helped create and lead educational activities, and ran "pledge booths" that encouraged visitors to pledge to do an action, such as recycling, that will have a positive effect on the environment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nature Exchange</span>- The Nature Exchange is where visitors can come and trade in bones, rocks, shells, minerals, and fossils for a certain number of points and, in turn, use those points to "buy" other nature items.<img src="http://s3.zoochat.com.s3.amazonaws.com/large/dallas_zoo_480-133339.jpg"; id="chimp"; style="width:300px"; align="right" /> Conservation Guides help out by sorting and organizing the Nature Exchange inventory, helping guests find what they're looking for, and, when it's busy, helping visitors buy items so that the zookeepers aren't overwhelmed with questions and requests.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Underzone</span>- Although the Junior Zookeepers rarely help in the Underzone,<img src="http://www.zoolex.org/zoolexstat/pictdir//1122/9.jpg"; id="chimp"; style="width:300px"; align="right" /> it's my favorite place to help in because of the interesting animals, like the naked mole rat. I also enjoy the Underzone because of its creative learning environment, such as how the decorations and architecture make you feel like you're an animal that lives underground. In the Underzone, the JZs normally sweep the floors and wash the windows.
