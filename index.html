				I graduated from Junior Zookeeper once I turned 13 and became a <span>Conservation Guide (CG)</span>. Unlike Junior Zookeepers, who work closer with the animals and their matinence, Conservation Guides focus on guest interaction.<img src="http://i.imgur.com/e39oBbS.png"; align="left"; id="JZLogo"; style="height:150px" /> Conservation Guides teach children about different animals, their role in nature, and will always try to leave a positive message about animal conservation with the kids.

				<span>The Barn</span>- The Barn is the the area where you do the most of the heavy work,<img src="http://dallas.citymomsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/03/The-Barn-2.jpg"; id="chimp"; style="width:300px"; align="right" /> like cleaning drainage gutters, cleaning horse stalls, washing food and water dishes, and dusting the water filtration system. While some of the activities don't seem very important or of priority, they all contribute into making the Childrens Zoo environment safe for the animals and welcoming for the zoo visitors.

				<span>The Underzone</span>- Although the Junior Zookeepers rarely help in the Underzone,<img src="http://www.zoolex.org/zoolexstat/pictdir//1122/9.jpg"; id="chimp"; style="width:300px"; align="right" /> it's my favorite place to help in because of the interesting animals, like the naked mole rat. I also enjoy the Underzone because of its creative learning environment, such as how the decorations and architecture make you feel like you're an animal that lives underground. In the Underzone, the JZs normally sweep the floors and wash the windows.
