				Once I turned 13, I graduated from Junior Zookeeper and became a <span>Conservation Guide (CG)</span>. Unlike Junior Zookeepers, who work closer with the animals and their maintenance, Conservation Guides focus on guest interaction and aquire the skills of <span>public interaction, responsibility, and initiative</span>.<img src="http://i.imgur.com/e39oBbS.png"; align="left"; id="JZLogo"; style="height:150px" /><img src="https://scontent-mia1-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/11098316_417326361805697_2024966877_n.jpg"; id="chimp"; style="width:250px"; align="right" /> Conservation Guides teach children about different animals, their role in nature, and will always try to leave a positive message about animal conservation with the kids. Animal conservation is a big focus at the Dallas Zoo and in the Conservation Guide program. We try to promote conservation through animal encounters, educational games, and creative crafts.

				<span>Places I have volunteered:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Discovery House</span>- The Discovery House is a small building filled with activities, games, and crafts that that teach kids about nature and animals. The activities in the Discovery House are targeted at preschoolers, so the Conservation Guides age appropriately tailor their presentations so that the younger kids can understand. We often have <span>animal encounters</span> in the Discovery House.<img src="http://i68.tinypic.com/dvhdsy.jpg"; id="chimp"; style="width:200px"; align="right" /> Animal encounters are when a zookeeper brings an animal, such as a snake or owl, and talks about it. At the beginning of the session, the Conservation Guides were only allowed to hold the animals. However, after we gained experience, we were also able to give the presentations. In the Discovery House, the CGs also cleaned, made animal enrichment (anything that animal can play with that enriches any of its senses), helped create and lead educational activities, and ran "pledge booths" that encouraged visitors to pledge to do an action, such as recycling, that will have a positive effect on the environment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nature Exchange</span>- The Nature Exchange is where visitors can come and trade in bones, rocks, shells, minerals, and fossils for a certain number of points and, in turn, use those points to "buy" other nature items.<img src="http://s3.zoochat.com.s3.amazonaws.com/large/dallas_zoo_480-133339.jpg"; id="chimp"; style="width:300px"; align="right" /> Conservation Guides help out by sorting and organizing the Nature Exchange inventory, helping guests find what they're looking for, and, when it's busy, helping visitors buy items so that the zookeepers aren't overwhelmed with questions and requests.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bird's Landing</span>-  Bird's Landing is a large enclosure where different types of birds fly<img src="https://scontent-mia1-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/11931111_466969670157343_1475948408_n.jpg"; id="chimp"; style="width:200px"; align="right" /> freely. Here, guests have the oppurtunity to feed the birds worms and birdseed. The Conservation Guides are responsible for making sure that the guests don't harm the birds, making sure no birds escape the enclosure, and offering the visitors assistance. 
			</p>

				Recently, my application was accepted and I will <span>continue my volunteering in the fall of 2016.</span> I'm very excited and am hoping that my volunteering experience will be as good as the previous years.
